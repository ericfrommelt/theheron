A plugin for news. Turn on or off as much meta data as you need. Also you can use the features on any post type you wish. 

== Description ==

Created by [Make Do](http://makedo.in/), this plugin gives you a custom post type for displaying your news. You can turn off the post type, and just use the meta boxes on their own. 

You can also query the post types and the custom meta data, however you wish to build your own news system.

Need to add detailed location information to your news? You can use our [Position](http://wordpress.org/plugins/position/) plugin, and associate any post type with a location.

If you are using this plugin in your project [we would love to hear about it](mailto:hello@makedo.in).

1. Backup your WordPress install
